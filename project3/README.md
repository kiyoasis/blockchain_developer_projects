Blockchain has the potential to change the way that the world approaches data. Develop Blockchain skills by understanding the data model behind Blockchain by developing your own simplified private blockchain.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].


### Configuring your project

- Use NPM to initialize your project and create package.json to store project dependencies.

```
- Install crypto-js with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install crypto-js --save
```
- Install level with --save flag
```
npm install level --save
```

- Install hopi.js with --save flag
```
npm install hopi --save
```

## Testing

To test code:
1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.
2: Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).
```
node server.js
```

3: Use Postman by (https://www.getpostman.com/) to send the HTTP requests.
  - To send GET message, specify the url as http://localhost:8000/block/{height}
